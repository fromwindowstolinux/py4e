# Autograder: Request-Response Cycle

**Exploring the HyperText Transport Protocol**

You are to retrieve the following document using the HTTP protocol in a way that you can examine the HTTP Response headers.

- http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt

There are three ways that you might retrieve this web page and look at the response headers:

- **Preferred:** Modify the socket1.py program to retrieve the above URL and print out the headers and data. Make sure to **change** the code to retrieve the above URL - the values are different for each URL.

- Open the URL in a web browser with a developer console or FireBug and manually examine the headers that are returned.

Enter the header values in each of the fields below and press "Submit".

# Autograder: Scraping HTML Data with BeautifulSoup

**Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup** 

In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will use **urllib** to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

- Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html (Sum=2553)
- Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_1235855.html (Sum ends with 33)

You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. 

**Note:** Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

**Data Format**

The file is a table of names and comment counts. You can ignore most of the data in the file except for lines like the following:

```
<tr><td>Modu</td><td><span class="comments">90</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Kenzie</td><td><span class="comments">88</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hubert</td><td><span class="comments">87</span></td></tr>
```

You are to find all the ```<span>``` tags in the file and pull out the numbers from the tag and sum the numbers.

Look at the [sample code](https://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py?PHPSESSID=a36d135210bc228ed30aa4b5520db76a) provided. It shows how to find all of a certain kind of tag, loop through the tags and extract the various aspects of the tags.

```
...
# Retrieve all of the anchor tags
tags = soup('a')
for tag in tags:
   # Look at the parts of a tag
   print 'TAG:',tag
   print 'URL:',tag.get('href', None)
   print 'Contents:',tag.contents[0]
   print 'Attrs:',tag.attrs
```

You need to adjust this code to look for **span** tags and pull out the text content of the span tag, convert them to integers and add them up to complete the assignment.

**Sample Execution**

```
$ python3 solution.py
Enter - http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html
Count 50
Sum 2...
```

# Autograder: Following Links with BeautifulSoup

**Following Links in Python**

In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the name for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment

- Sample problem: Start at http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html

Find the link at position **3** (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process **4** times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.

Sequence of names: Fikret Montgomery Mhairade Butchi Anayah

Last name in sequence: Anayah

- Actual problem: Start at: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Christianna.html

Find the link at position **18** (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process **7** times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.

Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: M

**Strategy**

The web pages tweak the height between the links and hide the page after a few seconds to make it difficult for you to do the assignment without writing a Python program. But frankly with a little effort and patience you can overcome these attempts to make it a little harder to complete the assignment without writing a Python program. But that is not the point. The point is to write a clever Python program to solve the program.

**Sample execution**

Here is a sample execution of a solution:

```
$ python3 solution.py
Enter URL: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
Enter count: 4
Enter position: 3
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Montgomery.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Mhairade.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Butchi.html
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Anayah.html
```

The answer to the assignment for this execution is "Anayah".
