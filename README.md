# PY4E

[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) is a free web site by Dr Charles Severance or best known as DR. Chuck. Once the learners have logged in, they have access to course-style features of the web site.

As the learners go through the [Lessons](https://www.py4e.com/lessons) in the course, they will see additional links to the _Autograder_ in the class. They can attempt the _Autograder_ and get a score.

They can track their progress through the course using the [Assignments](https://www.py4e.com/assignments) tool and when they complete a group of assignments, they can earn a [Badge](https://www.py4e.com/badges). They can download these badges and host them on their web site or refer the badge URLs from the site.

If any of the learners want to use the Creative Commons Licensed materials in their classes, they can download or link to the artifacts on the site, export the course material as an IMS Common Cartridge®, or apply for an IMS Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI®) key and secret to launch the autograders from their LMS.

The site uses Tsugi framework to embed a learning management system into it and provide the autograders. If any of the learners are interested in collaborating to build these kinds of sites for themselves, they can check out the [Tsugi](tsugi.org) website and/or contact Dr Chuck.

Dr. Chuck is actually a racer and has a race car, it is called the SakaiCar. He races in a series called 24 Hours of Lemons.

# Lessons

| Lesson | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Lesson 1](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/install) | Installing Python | The first task is to work through the installation steps including installing Python and text editor. |
| [Lesson 2](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/intro) | Why Program? | Learn why one might want to learn to program, and look at the basic issues with learning to program. |
| [Lesson 3](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/memory) | Variables, Expressions and Statements | Learn how to make variables and store data in those variables. |
| [Lesson 4](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/logic) | Conditional Execution | Look at how Python executes some statements and skips others. |
| [Lesson 5](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/functions) | Functions | Take a brief look at how Python implements the 'store and use later' programming pattern. |
| [Lesson 6](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/loops) | Loops and Iterations | Look at how Python repeats statements using looping structures. |
| [Lesson 7](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/strings) | Strings | Look at how Python stores and manipulates textual data using string variables and functions. |
| [Lesson 8](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/files) | Files | Learn how to open data files on the computer and read through the files using Python. |
| [Lesson 9](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/lists) | Lists | Look at Python's simplest data structure - the list. Lists can store more than one item in a variable. |
| [Lesson 10](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/dictionary) | Dictionaries | The dictionary data structures allows us to store multiple values in an object and look up the values by their key. |
| [Lesson 11](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/tuples) | Tuples | The tuple is a Python data structure that is like a simple and efficient list. |
| [Lesson 12](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/regex) | Regular Expressions | Regular Expressions allow to search for patterns in strings and extract data from strings using the regular expression programming language. |
| [Lesson 13](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/network) | Network Programming | Take a quick look at how data moves across the network using the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and how we write programs to read data across the network. |
| [Lesson 14](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/servces) | Using Web Services | Web services allow a program to access data available in a different server. |
| [Lesson 15](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/Objects) | Object-Oriented Programming | Do a quick look at how Python supports the Object-Oriented programming pattern. |
| [Lesson 16](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/database) | Databases | Databases give very fast random access to large amounts of data. There is a lot of material in this chapter as the learners learn the Structured Query Language (SQL). |
| [Lesson 17](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/dataviz) | Data Visualization | In this section, Learners learn to scrape data from the network, store the data in a database and then read the data from the database to produce in in-browser visualization of the data. |
