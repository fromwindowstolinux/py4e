# PY4E

[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) is a free web site by Dr Charles Severance or best known as DR. Chuck. Once the learners have logged in, they have access to course-style features of the web site.

As the learners go through the [Lessons](https://www.py4e.com/lessons) in the course, they will see additional links to the _Autograder_ in the class. They can attempt the _Autograder_ and get a score.

They can track their progress through the course using the [Assignments](https://www.py4e.com/assignments) tool and when they complete a group of assignments, they can earn a [Badge](https://www.py4e.com/badges). They can download these badges and host them on their web site or refer the badge URLs from the site.

If any of the learners want to use the Creative Commons Licensed materials in their classes, they can download or link to the artifacts on the site, export the course material as an IMS Common Cartridge®, or apply for an IMS Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI®) key and secret to launch the autograders from their LMS.

The site uses Tsugi framework to embed a learning management system into it and provide the autograders. If any of the learners are interested in collaborating to build these kinds of sites for themselves, they can check out the [Tsugi](tsugi.org) website and/or contact Dr Chuck.

Dr. Chuck is actually a racer and has a race car, it is called the SakaiCar. He races in a series called 24 Hours of Lemons.
